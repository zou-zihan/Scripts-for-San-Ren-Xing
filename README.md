# Script for San Ren Xing Restaurant

The San Ren Xing Super App is all you need for doing paper works while working in San Ren Xing Restaurant, it can do night audit, takeaway box inventory, drink inventory, stock count, work shedule and more.

This comes a long way, the very first version of this script only have no more than 900 lines of code, doing the most basic task, as time progresses, and I got better at Python programming, it now has more than 6000 lines of code, capable of doing a lot more tasks.

I am a typical restaurant manager who loves programming, and hope to pass boring paper works for machines to finish with less time and greater accuracy.

We are a small restaurant branch in Singapore, offering mainly Hokkien cuisines, Dim Sum and a little Sichuan food. Currently we have three branches in Singapore at Thomson Plaza, Bugis Junction, and Bedok Mall. I am in-charge of Bugis Junction.

# How to Use
If you are an employee of the company who needs to handle cashier and stock count tasks. You may contact me, I will issue you copies of 'fernet key.txt', 'Local Script.py', 'google auth bot.json' files in order to use my app. IDE you will use is Jupyter Notebook, you may use the app on company iPad, your phone or laptops. 

The 'Local Script.py' file is a small script that enables a connection to GitHub to get my script I uploaded on GitHub. The small script also can be found on GitHub as I have enclosed in the docstring.

The 'fernet_key.txt' file is the key to decrypt some encrypted URLs which connect to our online 'Database' and some rules I have implemented for machine to follow when running several tasks.

The 'google auth bot.json' file is the service file provided by Google that allows me to manipulate Google Sheet contents with Python script.

All the three files must be present to be able to run the San Ren Xing Super App.

# Intention of the Script
Pass the repetitive tasks for machine to finish, let's focus more on increasing service and food quality!
